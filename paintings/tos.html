        <h3>How to Use</h3>
        Enter a prompt (such as "a monkey eating a watermelon while jumping over a tree in a colorful tropical forest") and select an art style.<br>
        3 unique images will be generated each time you press the generate button.<br>
        Doing so uses up 1 credit, which you can stock up on using the "+" button in the top right corner.
